Cloudfoundry Demo

Prior to starting the demo head on over to SAP to sign up for a free trial account:


With account in hand, read through all the files which begin with numbers, each file is one step in the demo

You may run them either in a new shell
bash 1_InstallCli

or by sourcing them into your existing shell
source 1_InstallCli

Some steps may require more interactions than others, some may require tools but may be worked around (like downloading a zip of a repo instead of cloning it)
